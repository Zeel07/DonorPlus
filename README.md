#### Frameworks used

> We as a team chose Bootstrap mainly because it is responsive and mobile-first. The html,css and javascript framework which bootstrap provides saves a lot of time while development. Bootstrap also offers cutomizability which adjusts as per our project's requirements. Bootstrap is compatible with HTML5 and CSS3 and its grid system of layout offers a great degree of flexibility to align icons. Our design phase of DoRe includes extensive list of components and bootstrap helps us to style and code these components well.

#### API's used - Google Maps Javascript API

> In our design phase we decided to provide the flexibility to user to enter the address manually while creating a post or pick from google maps. In order to integrate this feature and embed google maps into website, I have used Google Maps Javscript API. This allows a user to pick a location on the map using a marker or enter some location details in a text box and search for it. In both the cases an address text box will be populated with the address picked. Contrary to that, user can enter the address manually in the adress text box too.

#### Test Cases
> Front-end has been valdiates with the W3C validator to verify its accuracy, hence avoiding any errors and making the pages W3C compliant.

> Login Validation
Both the username and password field are marked mandatory. 

>Sign-up Validation
All the fileds on the sign-up page are mandatory and form-validation is in place.

----
#### Responsive Check
All the pages are completely responsive which means it fits perfectly in smaller screen sizes of any ratio. Moreover, cross browser testing has been perfomed to check the webpages are compatible on various web browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge).
